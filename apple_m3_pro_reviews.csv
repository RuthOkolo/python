1,R2Y840YO94QJNT,Guy Boisvert,Defective Keyboard,1,05-Apr-24,Returned to Amazon
2,R1TJ3JBAB212Y9,E. Simon,Big Improvement over Intel Models,5,19-Jun-24,"I purchased the 14"" model with the 18 Gb of integrated memory/M3 Pro."
3,R2IKN4C7IY9Q93,Mick Pier,Great features and long battery life.,5,31-May-24,"I use this macBook mostly for photo editing and storage. I like the built in SD card reader. It also has 3 Thunderbolt ports, and a MagSafe charging cable."
4,R1WX22WWE57KQS,Steven Rossi,Not designed like previous versions,5,19-Jul-24,I've been an Apple user since the beginning. At one time you could count on the hardware build quality and the overall design being premium. At one time you felt as if you were navigating a Mercedes.
5,R2VI2SLQYUX0ML,Danielle Babu,Husbands Gift,5,28-May-24,"My husband ordered this off of my Amazon account on Motherâs Day. He seems to love it and according to him, he really needed it for work. He says it was great value for our money, because of the price but also because he thinks he can make us rich one day. It looks like a nice laptop. I hope he enjoys it. He has had no complaints about it."
6,R3Q1WYN2VYW9MF,WestCoastJJ,BLOWN SPEAKERS but otherwise great,5,01-Dec-23,The media could not be loaded.
7,R3LSMK6H7YWQ8H,Tyler Felts,First time mac user,5,14-Feb-24,"This laptop has unparalleled battery life, the screen is second only to Oled the notch is annoying and unnecessary but you get over it, they should really update the software so that the icons can't overflow under the notch. The keyboard is nice but it has very little travel, the trackpad is nice as well. Macos has its flaws but almost all of them can be fixed with third party tools, ie window snapping, keyboard history, gestures, ect... Keyboard shortcuts are a must for properly navigating the os. The one major thing lacking from this mac is the ability to play most games, but there is an active effort to solve that problem, and if you're really into gaming this laptop isn't for you. Also, this is touted as being great for video editing and photo editing, it is great for photo editng, plenty powerful and color accurate, however, video editing comes with a catch, it does everything well as long as is doesn't require 3d from a gpu such as noise reduction, in that case a proper dedicated gpu puts it to shame, a clip that takes 20 mins on a desktop 4090 will take 3-5 hours on this mac. Overall, as long as you have a desktop pc to fill the gaps of heavy duty video editing and gaming, this laptop is the perfect laptop for you honestly, even as someone who hated macos before I bought this. If this is going to be your only computer, just know that you will be severely lacking in said areas."
8,R3U8GOU394V3P4,Eric,Great laptop!,5,02-Mar-24,"I'm coming from a m1 macbook air which had 8gb ram and i switched to this one to be my main coding/work laptop. Apps like Unity, Xcode compile things so fast it's amazing, major time savor and i can have so many applications and chrome tabs open without this laptop break a sweat. One thing that also really suprised me is the quality of the speakers, so much better than the m1 macbook and also the keyboard is very comfortable/snappy to use. I'm very happy with this purchase."
9,RNVK67OP21FVZ,duplissi,14 Inch M3 Pro MacBook Pro Review,4,23-Nov-23,"Unboxing & Design: Standard unboxing, nothing extraordinary. The laptop feels solid, thanks to the unibody aluminum build. Love that ports are back!, but I'm really not a fan of the webcam notch â a larger top bezel or a different design would be better. The space black finish is nice, it appears more like a gunmetal grey in bright light, but in low light or oblique angles it is very black."
10,R2VSTVITC0I0PN,ballajay3,Just getting use to it,5,15-Jul-24,"I've had this for a few weeks so far and it makes a huge difference from my previous laptop.  I have a 2017 HP laptop and this one blows it out the water.  It's really fast, the gaming graphics and speed are fantastic, and the battery life is good.  I still haven't learned all the hotkeys and other cool features on it but, I'll have plenty of time for that.  I would recommend anyone looking to step their game up to upgrade to this."
11,R3VGQEGVZ1TLME,Alejandro C.,First time macbook user and had higher expectations,4,29-May-24,It freezes very frequently while doing easy tasks like browsing on Chrome/Safari or using the finder. User experience is somewhat nice but the software development experience has been much better for me on Linux (quickly switching tabs or frequently using keyboard shortcuts causes some lags that are quite annoying).
12,R2JZ0OG8VM5Z6R,Traci,Spectacular Laptop!,5,23-Jul-24,This laptop has exceeded my expectations!  A true luxury item well worth the money!
13,RYWSNXBIM0PTK,doggie lover,Great Deal,5,24-Jul-24,Refurbished and like new. Very pleased with the condition and performance of this laptop.
14,R5GW48RC3WXJV,Diyosha McGee,Beautiful Piece of Texh,5,21-Jul-24,"Love it, not too much say, love it!! Said it again"
15,R1H16SX3XFPMMM,Claudinei,Very happy,5,20-Jul-24,I bought an invitation from what the machine could deliver.
16,RTMVS2YKN4BBP,Ryan,My best purchase yet !,5,01-Jun-24,"I can truly say the m3 max chip is beyond the speed and specs youâll get compared to a gaming pc, Iâm on my second week using a Mac system overall, Iâm really impressed on how responsive apple has made their processors over time, which made my work flow 2X times as fast as my previous laptop, this one I recommend ! đđž also s/o to adoroma for the deal"
17,R1U3WE9BGZK5IU,Donnie Johnson,"Great Laptop, but minor inconveniences",4,26-May-24,"Love the laptop, but I canât get the time/date function to stay accurate. Whenever I close my laptop and donât use it for a few days. I will come back and the date/time will be wrong."
18,R2UE90KEJQ3ZMU,Giovanni Rinaldi,Excelente,5,14-Jun-24,Excelente

20,R2ZCKTQ619BMPW,Saen,Mac Power,5,17-May-24,"As a wedding videographer who films in 4K, I need a laptop that can handle heavy editing, and this Mac does the job perfectly. There are no lags at all. Coming from a PC, I was hesitant at first, but the Mac really delivers in terms of speed and power. Plus, the display is fantastic for color grading, making my editing process much smoother and more efficient."
21,R33EBJUTTOH1B7,Sean Bartholomew,Great product,4,28-Apr-24,Only thing is that itâs not recognizing my flash drive
22,RFH0GX5AXZ523,doworkk42,love it!!,5,04-May-24,"upgraded my 2015 macbook air. absolutely in love with this new macbook!! great product. liking a lot of the new features like fingerprint scanner, retina display, and usbc ports. definitely would recommend"
23,R1U3UF6XYII3OU,Rajamoon,I like it but,4,20-Mar-24,I liked the lap top but apple should think about putting num pad at least for pro series. Accounts and data analytics can be more attractives towards numpad options
24,R3SY10DMGVNHUG,Amazon Customer,Works Great,5,17-May-24,Easy to set up Nice appearance
25,RVD8XWSAFU8VC,Leahhh,My Favorite,5,05-May-24,"This laptop is unmatched. Fast, sleek, and Apple. The look is amazing and it seems to load faster than anything Iâve ever used"
26,RXQFG4EBONLI0,MT,Amazing Macbook Worth Every Penny.,5,09-Mar-24,"I decided to replace my 2013 MacBook Pro with a new one. After comparing the M3 and M3pro with my needs I went with the pro. This laptop is cutting edge with its processing. You can run all the monder applications you want without this laptop overheating or draining too much battery. The computer is quiet when working and the stock speakers even sound great. Overall, you will love this laptop."
27,R1HSVTIE0GBLRG,Rahul Patil,Great laptop,5,29-Apr-24,It's a loaded laptop for everyday need and perfect for work. Awesome.. love it. Nice packing by Amazon.

29,RC71DOMRSCINM,Zack,Apple does it again,5,16-Mar-24,"I understand Macs aren't for everyone, personally, I love them for their design, software and reliability. The 14â is the perfect size for me for portable power and the new darker color is beautiful. Perfect fit for me."
30,R2VKS81A8N4CKY,Yolanda Young,The price,5,19-Mar-24,The price was the ONLY reason I came to Amazon instead of Apple. Our daughter needed it for college. Everything works just fine. She hasnât complained about anything.
31,R3CWGHUALPL5C0,Ricardo Ramrez,Mi primera MacBook,5,18-Dec-23,"Este es mi primera MacBook Pro y definitivamente se siente la diferencia con otras laptop que he tenido, la pantalla definitivamente no tiene nada de flickering como leĂ­ en un comentario antes de hacer la compra, es una muy buena inversiĂłn si lo que buscas es un buen equipo para trabajar como desarollador."
32,R2KU6WZIQ3C52L,Joyce,La mejor inversiĂłn,5,27-Mar-24,Trabajo en programas de ediciĂłn de videos y grĂĄficos y hasta el momento no me ha dado problemas. Es muy rĂĄpida.

36,R3EKLND2X41FHL,C. Daniels,Great build quality and performance,5,29-Feb-24,"Letâs be honest, youâre not buying this on a whim. You already know what youâre in for if youâve reached the point where youâre buying a Pro instead of an Air. Great build quality, battery performance, screen, etc."
37,RHV2Q1HUKPV9A,Richard Mark Hester,An Apple A Day!,5,28-Mar-24,I continue to love my Apple Products.  Dependable and well worth the money!  Thank you!  Mark

41,RXGH00DBJX5DO,Sergo,Overall it is very good but price per value could be better,3,15-Jan-24,"I upgraded from MacBook m1 Air and compare to it, this one is really better but not that much that price difference is, for average users there is even no difference, maybe m1 air is better for average users."
42,R35L6N02VPMJQ6,Carlos J,Just disappointing,2,18-Jul-24,"I was really looking forward to using the MacBook pro but it has been a huge let down, it has many impressive specs on paper like the 10 core GPU but the actual performance didn't meet what I expected. At the beginning the everyday tasks felt good but as the weeks passed they started to fell sluggish and the battery life which promised up to 20 something hours barely lasted half a day with some use."
43,R2YYAG882VXWCK,Longsheng Huang,Beautiful and Fast.,5,10-Dec-23,"Itâs my second MacBook Pro. I upgraded from MacBook Pro 2018. itâs a big jump. The new color space black is beautiful. This new M3 Max can easily handle two 4k monitors at same time smoothly. Super fast and I liked the MagSafe 3 cable also comes with dark color. Battery life is great, got around 40% left after one day of light use. Personally so satisfied."

50,R3TK8ECJJ85330,Amazon customer,"So far, i am happy with the purchase",5,07-Jan-24,"I purchased M3 Max, 14 inch macbook pro. Size is right for me. I have not seen significant heat dissipation from this laptop so far. Wanted to see how it performs in long run."

70,RMKMJXVO3U3W6,Amazon customer,Not the product,1,12-Jun-24,The MacBook is steller. Amazon is the problem. The MacBook went on sale days after I bought it. The only way to get the price difference is return the MacBook and buy it at the sale price
71,RF7MA92XF222I,Lance,Good Laptop. Bad Amazon Returns,1,05-Jul-24,The laptop is decent but taking a month or more for Amazon to refund is pathetic.
